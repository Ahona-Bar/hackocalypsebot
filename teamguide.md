# üßü‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Project Hackocalypse: LLM Survival Guide 

 @Twinkle @Ahona @Yash - I've set up the repo structure and basic documentation.

## The Plan

### Phase 1: Initial Setup (Week 1-2)
- [x] Set up GitHub repository (Done by me)
- [ ] **@Twinkle**: Set up project documentation
  - Create comprehensive guides for participants
  - Document API usage and requirements
  - Design evaluation metrics documentation
  - Create sample scenarios with Ahona

- [ ] **@Ahona**: Design sample scenarios
  - Create 3-4 different city map descriptions
  - Design zombie outbreak patterns (make them interesting!)
  - Plan resource distribution scenarios
  - Document weather hazard scenarios
  - Develop "story mode" for each scenario

- [ ] **@Yash**: Technical infrastructure
  - Set up Groq API integration
  - Create baseline RAG implementation
  - Design evaluation scripts
  - Set up testing environment

### Phase 2: Content Creation (Week 2-3)
- [ ] Documentation polish
  - Participant guide
  - Setup instructions
  - Submission guidelines
  - FAQ section

- [ ] Sample Data Creation
  - Map descriptions (remember to make them detailed but parse-able)
  - Real-time update formats
  - Resource availability data
  - Weather condition updates
  - Zombie movement patterns 

### Phase 3: Testing (Week 3-4)
- [ ] Internal testing round
  - Test all scenarios
  - Run baseline implementation
  - Verify evaluation metrics
  - Test submission pipeline

- [ ] External beta testing
  - Get feedback from other MLSA members
  - Run a mini-pilot with volunteers
  - Document common issues

## Repository Structure
```
hackocalypse/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/           # Twinkle's domain
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scenarios/      # Ahona's domaion
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/            # Yash's domain
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ evaluation/     # Shared responsibility
```

## Scenario Types
1. **Urban Evacuation**
   - Multiple escape routes
   - Dynamic obstacles
   - Resource checkpoints

2. **Resource Management**
   - Limited supplies
   - Strategic decision-making
   - Risk vs reward scenarios

3. **Weather Hazards**
   - Dynamic weather patterns
   - Environmental challenges
   - Survival conditions

4. **Zombie Patterns**
   - Outbreak zones
   - Horde movements
   - Safe zones

## Technical Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Groq API access
- Vector store (FAISS/Pinecone)
- Web interface (Streamlit/Gradio)

## Individual Responsibilities

### Twinkle
- Lead documentation efforts
- Create participant guides
- Design evaluation rubrics
- Work on scenario documentation with Ahona

### Ahona
- Design engaging scenarios
- Create map descriptions
- Plan zombie outbreak patterns
- Design resource distribution

### Yash
- Set up technical infrastructure
- Implement baseline solution
- Create evaluation scripts
- Handle API integration

## Timeline
- Week 1: Initial setup and planning
- Week 2: Content creation and documentation
- Week 3: Testing and refinement
- Week 4: Final preparations and dry run

## Notes & Random Thoughts
- Remember to keep the scenarios challenging but solvable
- We need to test edge cases thoroughly
- Let's make the zombie scenarios extra spicy 
- Don't forget to add easter eggs in the map descriptions 
- Keep documentation fun but professional

## Communication
- Daily updates in Discord
- Weekly sync calls
- Emergency hotline: WhatsApp group

## Next Steps
1. Everyone: Review this document and add suggestions
2. Start working on assigned tasks
3. Plan next sync call



P.S. - please don't make the zombies TOO intelligent, we want the participants to have a fighting chance
